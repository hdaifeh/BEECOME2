Key methods in the EquipmentValorisation2 class:
- `init(int sizeData, int KMethaniseur, int KIncinerator, int KnbCompostPro)`: Initializes the equipment capacities and arrays.
- `iterate(int year, double fluxAv, double fluxAa, double fluxDv, double fluxOMR)`: Performs the waste treatment for a given year, considering the incoming waste flows from the territories.

The EquipmentValorisation2 class ensures the efficient treatment of biowaste flows, prioritizing the use of the methanizer, followed by the professional composting platform, and finally the incinerator. It manages surplus waste by redistributing it to the appropriate treatment options based on available capacities.

The class assumes that there is one set of common equipment (methanizer, professional composting platform, incinerator) shared by one or more territories. It also assumes that there is at most one professional composting platform per territory.

The waste treatment follows a specific order:
1. Methanization: The incoming waste flows from door-to-door collection (fluxAv for green waste and fluxAa for food waste) are first processed in the methanizer. If there is a surplus exceeding the methanizer's capacity, the green waste is redirected to the professional composting platform, and any remaining surplus of food waste is sent to the incinerator.
2. Professional Composting: The incoming waste flow from the waste collection center (fluxDv) and any surplus green waste from the methanizer (sMv) are processed in the professional composting platform. If there is a surplus exceeding the platform's capacity, it is redistributed to the methanizer if there is available capacity, and any remaining surplus is sent to the incinerator.
3. Incineration: The residual household waste (fluxOMR) and any surplus from the professional composting platform that couldn't be processed in the methanizer (sFv_inci) are sent to the incinerator.

The EquipmentValorisation2 class provides detailed management of biowaste treatment, optimizing the use of available capacities and ensuring the efficient valorization of waste flows from the territories.

The main workflow of the MultiSimParam2 class is as follows:
1. The class reads the parameter sets from a specified file.
2. It creates a MyModel2 object for each set of parameters and executes the simulation.
3. The simulation results can be saved to an output file at a specified frequency.
4. The class keeps track of the progress by printing a message after each simulation run.

The command-line arguments for running the MultiSimParam2 class are as follows:
- The name of the parameter file.
- (Optional) The starting line number and ending line number of the parameter sets in the file.
- (Optional) `-o` followed by the output file name.
- (Optional) `-f` followed by the frequency of saving results.

If the required parameters are not provided or there is a problem with the command-line arguments, the `messageParam()` method is called to display a reminder message about the expected parameters.

Overall, the MultiSimParam2 class provides a convenient way to run multiple simulations with different parameter sets by automating the process of reading parameters from a file and executing the MyModel2 class for each set of parameters. It simplifies the task of running batch simulations and allows for easy customization of the output and saving frequency.
