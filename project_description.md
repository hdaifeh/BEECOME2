# Project Description

## Overview
BEECOME2 is a Java-based project designed to model and analyze the dynamics of biowaste infrastructure. 
This project aims to understand how human behavior and infrastructure interact to achieve biowaste policy objectives. 
It includes multiple Java classes that represent different components of biowaste management.

## Objectives
- **Model Biowaste Infrastructure**: Develop a stock and flow model of biowaste.
- **Analyze Human Behavior**: Study the impact of human behavior on biowaste management.
- **Policy Implications**: Provide insights for policy-making to improve biowaste outcomes.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Simulation**: Simulate the dynamics of biowaste over time.
- **Behavior Analysis**: Analyze the effects of human behaviors on biowaste management.
- **Infrastructure **: linear function.

## Class Descriptions
- **Dynamics2.java**: This class handles the dynamic aspects of the biowaste.
- **EquipmentValorisation2.java**: Manages the equipment and valorization processes within the biowaste management system.
- **MonModel2.java**: Contains the primary model for biowaste management, integrating various components.
- **MultiSimParam2.java**: Defines parameters for conducting multiple simulations to test different scenarios.
- **MyModel2.java**: Represents an alternative model for comparative analysis and validation.
- **Myterritory2.java**: Manages territorial data and interactions, crucial for localized biowaste management.
- **Subterritory2.java**: Handles collection territories details and data, allowing for more granular analysis.

## Future Directions
- **Enhanced Simulations**: Incorporate more complex simulations to capture a wider range of scenarios.
- **Behavioral Studies**: Conduct in-depth studies on human behavior related to biowaste management.
- **Policy Development**: Collaborate with policymakers to develop effective biowaste management policies.
